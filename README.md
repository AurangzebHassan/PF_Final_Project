# PF_Final_Project-
A basic inventory management system as my Programming Fundamentals (PF) final project.
The program starts and reads data into the structures from the binary file (Binary.dat).
A simple menu is displayed to the user and they can select their required option.
The user's choice executes the respective function and it perfroms the required functionalities.

Note : 
      The function, Retrieve_Inventory_Item() dosent't quite work properly and has issues. Unfortunately, I couldn't figure out how to implement my solution.
